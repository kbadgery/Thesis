Here I have used an artificial neural network to classify free weight exercises using acceleration data from a weight-mounted IMU. This is an extension of the work I did during my senior thesis project. The current version of this neural network has a senstivity of 89% for individual sliding windows. This is slightly below the 90.6% senstivity found using the linear discriminant model that was used as the final model in my thesis. It is possible that with additional tuning this neural network could outperform the linear discriminant model.  Some design choices (sliding window length and features used) were kept from the original thesis.
